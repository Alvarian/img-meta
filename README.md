# Introduction
A small UI script, with the use of exiftool, that can extract, inject, and read all meta data from an image.

## Getting Started
Run:
```
sudo ./run.sh <LOCATION OF IMAGE>
```

## Usage
Injection takes only two types of payloads. The first can be raw input through the terminal, or the second is a location of a text file.
